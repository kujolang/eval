# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — Production Release

### FEATURE
- Added a production-usable multi-stage `Dockerfile` that compiles the Kujo runtime from pinned `RUNTIME_VERSION` (with optional `KUJO_RUNTIME_REF` override) and runs `eval` via `kujo run main.kujo`.
- Added `examples/strict_enterprise_policy_gate.json` with minimum-privilege command/path/env policy defaults and redaction audit mode.
- Added `examples/sandbox_adjacent_policy_gate.json` for constrained fixture-only policy boundaries.
- Added `init --from-scout <path>` as an alias for `--from` to align Scout workflow docs with CLI behavior.
- Added `policy-explain` CLI command and `policy_explain_config` support to print effective merged command/path/env policy by stage.
- Added deterministic contract fixtures under `examples/fixtures/contracts/` for `summary.json`, `cli-summary.json`, `artifact-manifest.json`, and `policy-explain` payload validation.
- Added policy explain risk telemetry (`risk_score`, `risk_tier`, `risk_hints`) to support enterprise policy posture review.
- Added schema-driven lint diagnostics (`lint_config_file`) with stable error codes, locations, and actionable suggested fixes.
- Added named `path_policy_profile` presets (`open`, `ci-restricted`, `release-deny-default`) for top-level suites and stage overlays.
- Added richer JSON-path assertions for `json_value_equals` and `command_stdout_json_path_equals`, including array index traversal and `expected_type` checks.
- Added incremental report generation controls via `save_report_with_options` and command-level `--incremental` support.

### TWEAK
- Compacted CLI help rendering in `src/cli.kujo` behind a local `print_lines` helper while preserving the rendered help text.
- Updated README count verification to tolerate compact help text storage instead of requiring one literal `print(...)` call per help row.
- Extended `scripts/verify_docs_command_parity.sh` to validate strict-enterprise and sandbox-adjacent quickstart bundles.
- Extended `scripts/verify_docs_command_parity.sh` to validate the Scout ecosystem import path (`init --from-scout`) and broadened parity reporting to docs-wide scope.
- Added `.dockerignore` defaults to keep VCS metadata, transient eval outputs, and logs out of container build context.
- Added optional human signoff enforcement controls to `scripts/release_quality_gates.sh` via `KUJO_EVAL_REQUIRE_RELEASE_SIGNOFF` and `KUJO_EVAL_RELEASE_SIGNOFF_FILE`.
- Added changelog coverage gate to `scripts/release_quality_gates.sh` to fail when behavior-affecting changes land without `CHANGELOG.md` updates.
- Cleaned committed `tests/*.out` artifacts and standardized `.gitignore` to `tests/*.out` for runtime-generated outputs only.
- Updated CLI integration tests to resolve `KUJO_BIN` from environment with a `kujo` fallback instead of using a machine-specific absolute path.
- Updated the pinned Kujo runtime ref to the live `main` commit `108b87f83fbaf52372b32c9e90e023953d0b77b6` so runtime bootstrap and CI fetches remain functional.
- Updated CLI help/completion surface to include `policy-explain` and `verify-manifest` and surfaced incremental report metadata in JSON summaries.
- Updated schema policy fields to stage-aware `path_policy_mode` behavior (`open`/`allowlist-required`) for clearer governance defaults.

### FIX
- Fixed command-policy allowlist matching so commands allowed by later entries in `allowed_commands` are accepted without prefix-matching similarly named commands.
- Corrected release/supply-chain documentation gates to validate the actual root `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md` governance files.
- Hardened command safety evaluation in `src/checks.kujo` by normalizing case/whitespace before policy and dangerous-pattern checks.
- Added security regression coverage for uppercase dangerous-command bypass attempts.
- Restored stable report rendering flow after malformed patch collision in `src/report.kujo` and validated with full suite passes.
- Fixed an unbound-variable bug in `scripts/verify_docs_command_parity.sh` so Scout import parity checks execute deterministically.
- Fixed release and parity gates so generated `.out` baselines are produced and cleaned inside the gate instead of depending on stale ignored local files.

### SECURITY
- Added strict command policy enforcement controls for CI/release stages (`require_command_policy`) with stage overlay support.
- Added path allowlist enforcement mode for guarded stages and expanded policy introspection for command/path/env controls.
- Added validation and lint diagnostics for invalid path policy profiles, including stage-overlay profile names.
- Added outbound HTTP host governance for network checks with `allowed_http_hosts`/`blocked_http_hosts` and blocked-host precedence.
- Added organization-specific redaction extension patterns (`redact_output_patterns`) for command output sanitization.

### PERFORMANCE
- Added deterministic mixed-suite parallel scheduling heuristics and benchmark coverage for mixed check workloads.
- Extended deterministic parallel file fastpath to include `file_line_count`, `file_matches_glob`, and `file_matches_regex` with cache metrics (`cache_metric_*`) in run/report payloads.
- Added benchmark trend slope regression gating with rolling history and stage gate controls in `scripts/release_quality_gates.sh`.

### CI
- Expanded `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to a Linux + macOS matrix.
- Added Ubuntu CI coverage to build the pinned-runtime Docker image (`docker build`) and validate container workflow integrity.
- Added CI guard to reject tracked `tests/*.out` artifacts.

### DOCS
- Added canonical-example and generated/bulk search hygiene guidance for agents and contributors.
- Shortened the README quick start to a minimal runnable path with expected output signals.
- Updated local test command documentation to show the clean-checkout baseline generation step.
- Labeled `examples/basic_suite.json` as an expected-fail reporting demo.
- Added VM-first migration guidance for legacy interpreter-era commands in `README.md`.
- Added migration notes in `docs/agent-notes.md` and `docs/eval-suite-reference.md` to keep command guidance internally consistent.
- Added enterprise quickstart risk-tier matrices and copy/paste profile guidance in `README.md`, `docs/QUICKREF.md`, and `docs/COOKBOOK.md`.
- Added repository layout rationale in `README.md` explaining why `main.kujo` and package/governance files stay at root while implementation lives in `src/`.
- Documented path policy profiles in `README.md`, `docs/eval-suite-reference.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`, and `docs/QUICKREF.md`.
- Added container build/run documentation in `README.md` for pinned-runtime Docker workflows.
- Added `docs/release-signoff.md` template and runbook guidance for optional human approval enforcement in release gates.
- Updated `docs/ECOSYSTEM.md` Scout import example to use canonical `kujo run main.kujo init --from-scout ...` invocation.
- Added generated command inventory docs (`docs/COMMAND_INVENTORY.md`) with freshness checks via `scripts/generate_command_inventory.sh --check`.
- Updated release runbook guidance for benchmark trend slope environment overrides and command inventory verification.
- Corrected `kennel.toml` package status notes to reflect the actual CLI/test surface and remaining release workflow tasks.

- `describe_module()` contract discovery function on main.kujo
- Enhanced `redact_sensitive`: now also catches `token=`, `api_key=`, `apikey=` patterns

### SECURITY
- Expanded `DANGEROUS_PATTERNS`: added `nc`, `ncat`, `telnet`, `eval`, `$(`, backtick, `; rm`, `|| rm`, `&& rm` patterns
