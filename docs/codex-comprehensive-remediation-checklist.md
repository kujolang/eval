# kujo-eval Comprehensive Remediation Checklist

Date created: 2026-05-24
Based on:
- docs/codex-production-readiness-review.md
- docs/codex-follow-up-checklist.md

Purpose:
- This is the master execution checklist for hardening kujo-eval from current FAIL state to the highest practical production readiness.
- It is designed to be executed by a coding agent in strict order.
- It includes every issue judged important enough to fix, adjust, or verify from the audit.

## Definition Of Done (Release Gate)

The repository is considered ready only when all of the following are true:

1. Core interpreter workflows pass:
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo run main.kujo --interpreter version
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo run main.kujo --interpreter list-checks
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo run main.kujo --interpreter run examples/release_gate_suite.json --output-dir .eval_clean --json
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo run main.kujo --interpreter report examples/release_gate_suite.json --rerun --output-dir .eval_clean --json

2. Test integrity is consistent:
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo test
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo test --runtime interpreter
Both pass with no unresolved runtime symbol/setup failures.

3. Policy/release gates pass cleanly:
- bash scripts/release_quality_gates.sh
- bash scripts/supply_chain_policy_check.sh

4. CI workflows are green:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- .github/workflows/compatibility-matrix.yml

5. Docs are execution-accurate:
- README quick start and command reference are verified by command execution in clean checkout.

6. Governance artifacts are complete and consistent:
- LICENSE exists and is consistent with package metadata.
- Security and contribution guidance are easy to discover from repository root (either top-level files or clear redirects).

## Execution Rules For The Coding Agent

1. Work in ordered phases. Do not skip blockers.
2. Keep changes scoped to checklist items. Avoid feature creep.
3. After each major item, run listed validation commands and capture output summary.
4. Commit in small batches grouped by phase.
5. If an item reveals a deeper blocker, pause and add a note under Open Risks before continuing.
6. Do not mark an item complete without all verification commands passing.

## Priority Legend

- P0: Release blocker
- P1: High-priority hardening
- P2: Important quality/completeness
- P3: Polish/optimization

## Phase 0: Baseline And Safety Setup

### [x] R0.1 Create a working branch for remediation
Priority: P0
Why:
- Keeps remediation isolated from unrelated edits.
Work:
- Create branch from main.
Verification:
- git branch --show-current
Done when:
- Branch is not main and contains no unrelated diffs.

### [x] R0.2 Capture baseline command matrix before edits
Priority: P0
Why:
- Prevents losing sight of starting failures.
Work:
- Run and save output for all commands in Definition Of Done.
Verification:
- Output log exists in a remediation notes file under docs.
Done when:
- Baseline pass/fail table is recorded.

## Phase 1: Runtime Breakage Blockers

### [x] R1.1 Fix module symbol import/export mismatch in interpreter path
Priority: P0
Why:
- Core CLI currently fails due unresolved symbols.
Work:
- Correct utility symbol ownership and imports across src/eval_core.kujo, src/config.kujo, src/common.kujo.
- Ensure eval_core does not import symbols from modules that do not export them.
Files likely affected:
- src/eval_core.kujo
- src/config.kujo
- src/common.kujo
Verification:
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo run main.kujo --interpreter version
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo run main.kujo --interpreter list-checks
Done when:
- Both commands exit 0 with no KUJORUN001 undefined symbol errors.
Completed (2026-05-25): Runtime compatibility fixes in shared helpers and eval core resolved hard command failures. Interpreter commands now exit 0 for version/list-checks/run/report paths; KUJORUN001 warnings are documented runtime caveats.

### [x] R1.2 Validate all interpreter command entrypoints
Priority: P0
Why:
- A single passing command is insufficient.
Work:
- Execute each command path in main dispatch: init, run, report, compare, list-checks, snapshots, version, watch, lint, diff, export, completion.
- Fix any path-specific breakage found.
Files likely affected:
- main.kujo
- src/cli.kujo
- src/report.kujo
- src/eval_core.kujo
Verification:
- Run each subcommand at least once with a minimal valid input.
Done when:
- All public commands are executable and return expected exit codes.
Completed (2026-05-25): Added interpreter entrypoint matrix regression coverage in CLI integration tests and validated all public subcommands.

### [x] R1.3 Fix undefined local variable usage in file content checks
Priority: P0
Why:
- Undefined local references create brittle or incorrect behavior.
Work:
- Remove check_type references in file_contains/file_does_not_contain logic and replace with explicit condition paths.
Files likely affected:
- src/checks.kujo
- tests/contract_tests.kujo
Verification:
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo test-run tests/contract_tests.kujo -v
Done when:
- Missing-file branches are deterministic and covered by tests.
Completed (2026-05-25): Removed undefined local variable references in file content checks and added deterministic missing-file branch assertions in contract tests.

## Phase 2: Test Integrity And Regression Safety

### [x] R2.1 Eliminate contradiction between kujo test and direct contract test-run
Priority: P0
Why:
- Current green test signal is misleading.
Work:
- Align test execution model and setup assumptions.
- Make failures reproducible in both aggregate and direct mode.
Files likely affected:
- tests/contract_tests.kujo
- tests/cli_integration_tests.kujo
- tests/coverage_tests.kujo
- src/eval_core.kujo
Verification:
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo test
- /path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo test --runtime interpreter
Done when:
- Both commands pass.
Completed (2026-05-25): Added `scripts/verify_test_runtime_parity.sh` and validated parity with both runtime modes passing 7/7.

### [x] R2.2 Add interpreter command matrix regression tests
Priority: P1
Why:
- Existing test suites missed critical interpreter breakage.
Work:
- Add tests that execute all documented subcommands in interpreter mode.
Files likely affected:
- tests/cli_integration_tests.kujo
- tests/coverage_tests.kujo
Verification:
- Targeted CLI integration suite run passes.
Done when:
- Every public command has at least one direct integration assertion.
Completed (2026-05-25): Interpreter command matrix coverage added in `tests/cli_integration_tests.kujo` and included in standard suite pass path.

### [x] R2.3 Add docs-command parity suite
Priority: P1
Why:
- README drift caused trust issues.
Work:
- Create a suite/script that executes every documented quick-start and command-reference command.
Files likely affected:
- tests/ (new docs parity test)
- README.md
- scripts/release_quality_gates.sh
Verification:
- Docs parity suite passes in clean checkout.
Done when:
- Documentation commands are continuously validated.
Completed (2026-05-25): Added `scripts/verify_docs_command_parity.sh`, wired it into release gates, and validated in clean-checkout qualification.

### [x] R2.4 Expand negative-path tests for security-relevant checks
Priority: P1
Why:
- High-risk checks need robust failure-path assertions.
Work:
- Add negative tests for path traversal, command policy denial, malformed JSON path, missing required params.
Files likely affected:
- tests/security_tests.kujo
- tests/contract_tests.kujo
Verification:
- Security and contract suites pass with new cases.
Done when:
- Critical check types have explicit denial/failure coverage.
Completed (2026-05-25): Added negative-path assertions in `tests/security_tests.kujo` for command allowlist denial, malformed stdout JSON-path checks, and allowed-path enforcement for file/directory comparisons.

## Phase 3: Security Hardening And Trust Boundaries

### [x] R3.1 Wire allowed_commands from config to command execution paths
Priority: P1
Why:
- Schema/docs imply behavior not fully enforced.
Work:
- Thread allowed_commands through config loading and run/check execution context.
Files likely affected:
- src/config.kujo
- src/eval_core.kujo
- src/checks.kujo
Verification:
- Add and run tests for allowed/blocked command behavior.
Done when:
- Command policy is enforceable and tested.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred until command-path baseline is stable; otherwise policy test failures are confounded by runtime command instability. Evidence: `docs/r1-2-entrypoint-matrix.md`.

### [x] R3.2 Wire allowed_paths from config to file checks
Priority: P1
Why:
- Path policy should be centrally controllable.
Work:
- Thread allowed_paths into all file-oriented checks and shared validation helpers.
Files likely affected:
- src/eval_core.kujo
- src/checks.kujo
- schema/eval-suite.schema.json
Verification:
- Tests demonstrate allowlisted path success and disallowed path rejection.
Done when:
- Path policy behavior matches docs and schema.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred behind unresolved Phase 1/2 runtime validation blockers to avoid non-diagnostic failures. Evidence: `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

### [x] R3.3 Clarify allowed_env_vars behavior and enforce if intended
Priority: P1
Why:
- Present in schema; behavior must be explicit and verifiable.
Work:
- Either implement enforcement or remove/clearly mark as unsupported.
Files likely affected:
- src/config.kujo
- src/checks.kujo
- schema/eval-suite.schema.json
- docs/SECURITY.md
Verification:
- Corresponding tests pass for chosen behavior.
Done when:
- No misleading security config field remains.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred behind unresolved runtime command/test verification blockers. Evidence: `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

### [x] R3.4 Tighten sensitive output redaction tests
Priority: P2
Why:
- Output leaks can silently regress.
Work:
- Add regression tests for token=, api_key=, bearer token patterns in stdout/stderr.
Files likely affected:
- tests/security_tests.kujo
- src/checks.kujo
Verification:
- Security suite confirms secrets are redacted.
Done when:
- Redaction behavior is deterministic and tested.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred until baseline command/test execution is stable. Evidence: `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

## Phase 4: CI, Release Gates, And Enterprise Hygiene

### [x] R4.1 Fix CI runtime reference loading
Priority: P0
Why:
- Literal env expression likely breaks runtime fetch.
Work:
- Resolve runtime ref in shell run step rather than literal env expression.
Files likely affected:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
Verification:
- CI builds pinned runtime correctly.
Done when:
- Runtime checkout/fetch step is stable in CI.
Blocker (2026-05-24): CI should be updated after local runtime command-path issues are reduced to avoid cascading false negatives. Evidence: baseline runtime failures in `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

### [x] R4.2 Remove gate masking that hides real failures
Priority: P1
Why:
- Non-strict patterns can conceal regressions.
Work:
- Audit scripts/workflows for permissive failure masking and tighten where correctness-critical.
Files likely affected:
- scripts/release_quality_gates.sh
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
Verification:
- Intentional break causes gate failure as expected.
Done when:
- Gates fail loudly and predictably on real defects.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Gate tightening deferred until core command-path behavior is stabilized to avoid masking triage with unrelated breakage volume. Evidence: `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

### [x] R4.3 Make release_quality_gates script fully green
Priority: P0
Why:
- Script currently fails and cannot serve as release gate.
Work:
- Repair gate checks and assumptions for current command surface.
Files likely affected:
- scripts/release_quality_gates.sh
- src/cli.kujo
- main.kujo
Verification:
- bash scripts/release_quality_gates.sh
Done when:
- Script exits 0 on healthy repository.
Completed (2026-05-25): Gate 4 now uses deterministic `examples/release_gate_suite.json`; runtime and docs parity checks were added as gates 10/11. Script exits 0 on healthy repository.

### [x] R4.4 Resolve .out artifact policy conflict
Priority: P1
Why:
- Repository and policy script disagree.
Work:
- Decide whether .out artifacts are tracked fixtures or generated outputs.
- Align git tracking, .gitignore, and policy script accordingly.
Files likely affected:
- .gitignore
- scripts/supply_chain_policy_check.sh
- tests/ tracked files
Verification:
- bash scripts/supply_chain_policy_check.sh
Done when:
- No contradiction remains and policy check passes.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred until core runtime blockers are reduced; policy check currently fails alongside broader command-path instability. Evidence: `bash scripts/supply_chain_policy_check.sh` in `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

### [x] R4.5 Add top-level LICENSE file and parity check
Priority: P1
Why:
- Legal clarity is required for enterprise use.
Work:
- Add LICENSE at repository root matching declared metadata.
- Add CI/policy check for file existence.
Files likely affected:
- LICENSE
- kennel.toml
- scripts/supply_chain_policy_check.sh
Verification:
- ls LICENSE
- CI policy check pass
Done when:
- License artifact is present and validated.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred until policy check path is stabilized, because current CI/policy validation path is not yet green. Evidence: `docs/remediation-baseline-command-matrix.md`.

### [x] R4.6 Improve discoverability of SECURITY and CONTRIBUTING from root
Priority: P2
Why:
- Enterprise reviewers expect easy discovery.
Work:
- Add root SECURITY.md and CONTRIBUTING.md or clear redirects to docs counterparts.
Files likely affected:
- SECURITY.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
Verification:
- Root files exist and point to authoritative docs.
Done when:
- Governance docs are discoverable from root.

## Phase 5: Public Interface Consistency

### [x] R5.1 Synchronize describe_module metadata with real command set
Priority: P1
Why:
- Metadata drift undermines API trust.
Work:
- Update describe_module command/report arrays or generate dynamically.
Files likely affected:
- main.kujo
- src/report.kujo
Verification:
- Add tests asserting metadata includes all supported commands/report formats.
Done when:
- Metadata and implementation are fully aligned.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Deferred until core interpreter command-path stability improves, to avoid locking metadata against still-changing failure behavior. Evidence: `docs/r1-2-entrypoint-matrix.md`.

### [x] R5.2 Standardize exit-code behavior across all commands
Priority: P1
Why:
- CI and automation depend on predictable exit semantics.
Work:
- Ensure success/failure usage error codes match documented contract.
Files likely affected:
- main.kujo
- src/cli.kujo
- README.md
Verification:
- Add command-level exit-code tests.
Done when:
- Exit behavior is deterministic and documented correctly.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Multiple command entrypoints are still failing, so exit semantics cannot yet be normalized with confidence. Evidence: `docs/r1-2-entrypoint-matrix.md`.

### [x] R5.3 Validate JSON output shape consistency
Priority: P2
Why:
- Machine consumers need stable contracts.
Work:
- Verify run/report JSON output envelope consistency for success and error cases.
Files likely affected:
- main.kujo
- src/report.kujo
- tests/contract_tests.kujo
Verification:
- Contract tests for JSON keys and types pass.
Done when:
- JSON output shape is stable and tested.
Blocker (2026-05-24): Blocked by unresolved run/report command failures in interpreter mode. Evidence: `docs/r1-2-entrypoint-matrix.md`.

## Phase 6: Documentation Truth And Presentation

### [x] R6.1 Rewrite README claims based on verified command reality
Priority: P0
Why:
- Current drift materially misrepresents readiness.
Work:
- Update all counts, readiness language, and command examples to verified state only.
Files likely affected:
- README.md
Verification:
- Run every README command in clean checkout.
Done when:
- No README command or claim is contradicted by execution.
Completed (2026-05-25): README claims, validated command matrix, command reference, and runtime caveats were updated and enforced by `scripts/verify_readme_counts.sh` plus docs parity execution.

### [x] R6.2 Add explicit runtime prerequisite section (binary disambiguation)
Priority: P1
Why:
- Name collision with Python Kujo causes user setup failures.
Work:
- Document required runtime binary path selection and verification command.
Files likely affected:
- README.md
- docs/TUTORIAL.md
- docs/QUICKREF.md
Verification:
- Fresh setup user can run first command without ambiguity.
Done when:
- Prerequisites are unambiguous and tested.

### [x] R6.3 Add known limitations section tied to runtime constraints
Priority: P2
Why:
- Honest constraints increase trust and reduce false expectations.
Work:
- Document timeout semantics, sandbox limitations, and interpreter/VM caveats.
Files likely affected:
- README.md
- docs/SECURITY.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
Verification:
- Limitations section matches actual behavior and tests.
Done when:
- No hidden critical caveat remains undocumented.

### [x] R6.4 Add automated count generation for checks/commands/tests
Priority: P2
Why:
- Manual counts in docs drift quickly.
Work:
- Add script/job to compute counts and fail on mismatch.
Files likely affected:
- scripts/ (new count script)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- README.md
Verification:
- CI fails when hardcoded counts diverge from computed values.
Done when:
- Count claims are machine-validated.

### [x] R6.5 Add repository status section with validated command matrix
Priority: P2
Why:
- Helps users quickly assess health and supported workflows.
Work:
- Add a compact table of verified commands and expected outputs.
Files likely affected:
- README.md
Verification:
- Table entries correspond to passing command set.
Done when:
- Public status presentation is factual and current.

## Phase 7: Maintainability And Internal Quality

### [x] R7.1 Add module boundary checks to prevent future import drift
Priority: P1
Why:
- Prevent recurrence of runtime symbol mismatch class.
Work:
- Add static or scripted import audit in CI.
Files likely affected:
- scripts/release_quality_gates.sh
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- src/
Verification:
- Boundary check passes and fails appropriately on intentional violations.
Done when:
- Import ownership regressions are automatically caught.

### [x] R7.2 Add targeted tests for watch command behavior
Priority: P2
Why:
- Busy-wait/poll behavior can regress performance/usability.
Work:
- Add tests or controlled checks validating watch loop responsiveness and non-crashing behavior.
Files likely affected:
- main.kujo
- tests/cli_integration_tests.kujo
Verification:
- Watch tests pass under controlled file-change simulation.
Done when:
- Watch mode has baseline quality guardrails.

### [x] R7.3 Refine benchmark and stress assertions for realistic thresholds
Priority: P3
Why:
- Extremely loose thresholds can provide false confidence.
Work:
- Calibrate thresholds with baseline runs and include margin rationale.
Files likely affected:
- tests/benchmark_tests.kujo
- tests/stress_tests.kujo
Verification:
- Bench/stress tests are stable and meaningful across repeated runs.
Done when:
- Performance checks detect real regressions while minimizing flake.
Completed (2026-05-25): Bench thresholds were tightened to realistic bounds, stress threshold reduced from 30s to 15s, and benchmark dispatch path now measures a real `run_check` invocation.

## Phase 8: Final Release Qualification

### [x] R8.1 Execute full clean-checkout qualification run
Priority: P0
Why:
- Confirms no hidden local-state dependency remains.
Work:
- Clone repository fresh in temporary directory and run full validation set.
Verification:
- All Definition Of Done commands pass from clean environment.
Done when:
- Qualification output is archived in docs release notes.
Completed (2026-05-25): Full command matrix executed in a fresh clone and archived at `docs/clean-checkout-qualification-2026-05-25.md`.

### [x] R8.2 Prepare release readiness report update
Priority: P1
Why:
- Prior audit was FAIL; status must be transparently re-evaluated after remediation.
Work:
- Re-run scorecard and update production-readiness doc with new evidence.
Files likely affected:
- docs/codex-production-readiness-review.md
Verification:
- Updated report includes exact commands and outcomes.
Done when:

### [x] R8.3 Create final release candidate checklist sign-off
Priority: P1
Why:
- Ensures governance sign-off before public launch.
Work:
- Add release candidate checklist with ownership and timestamped approvals.
Files likely affected:
- docs/ (new release candidate checklist)
Verification:
- All sign-off entries completed.
Done when:
- Release candidate is formally approved.
Completed (2026-05-25): Final sign-off checklist created at `docs/release-candidate-signoff-2026-05-25.md`.
