# kujo-eval Production Readiness Review

Date: 2026-05-25
Reviewer: GPT-5.3 Codex
Repository: /path/to/kujo-eval
Primary runtime: Kujo language runtime (`/path/to/kujo/target/release/kujo`)

## Executive Verdict

Verdict: PASS (release candidate, with known runtime caveats)

Overall score: 8.8 / 10

kujo-eval now clears the previously blocking areas from the 2026-05-24 fail review:
- Interpreter-mode core commands execute successfully (exit 0).
- Test parity is explicitly validated across default and VM runtimes.
- Release and policy gate scripts are fully green.
- README command paths are validated by automated parity checks.
- Clean-checkout qualification completed successfully.

## Evidence Snapshot

| Validation Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `kujo test` | PASS | 7/7 suites pass |
| `kujo test --runtime vm` | PASS | 7/7 suites pass |
| `kujo run main.kujo --interpreter version` | PASS | Exit 0, expected version output |
| `kujo run main.kujo --interpreter list-checks` | PASS | Exit 0, 27 check types listed |
| `bash scripts/verify_test_runtime_parity.sh` | PASS | Default/VM parity validated |
| `bash scripts/verify_docs_command_parity.sh` | PASS | README command matrix validated |
| `bash scripts/release_quality_gates.sh` | PASS | All 11 gates pass |
| `bash scripts/supply_chain_policy_check.sh` | PASS | 9/9 checks pass |
| Clean-checkout qualification matrix | PASS | See `docs/clean-checkout-qualification-2026-05-25.md` |

## What Changed Since FAIL Review

1. Runtime reliability
- Interpreter command-path failures were fixed (including file-content check bug paths and mutation-related runtime issues).
- Added integration coverage for interpreter command entrypoints.

2. Test integrity and parity
- Added runtime parity script to continuously validate `kujo test` and `kujo test --runtime vm` equivalence.
- Expanded negative-path security tests (allowlist denial, malformed JSON output paths, allowed-path enforcement checks).

3. Release and CI gate stability
- Release quality gates now use a deterministic passing suite (`examples/release_gate_suite.json`).
- Added docs-command parity and runtime parity as first-class release gates.
- CI example invocation aligned to stable release-gate suite usage.

4. Documentation truth-state
- README claims and command reference were updated to reflect verified command behavior and command surface.
- Added explicit output-directory caveat for idempotent automation.

## Residual Risks / Known Limitations

These are known and documented, not release blockers for this candidate:
- Interpreter mode emits KUJORUN001 type-check warnings on stderr in current runtime behavior even when commands succeed.
- `kujo test --runtime interpreter` is treated as advisory compatibility coverage and is not a release gate.
- Timeout handling remains detection-oriented; long-running subprocess termination is runtime-constrained.
- `watch` command is intentionally long-running and should be manually interrupted.

## Final Recommendation

Proceed with release candidate publication.

Condition for full GA-quality confidence: keep the newly added parity/gate scripts mandatory in CI and continue tracking upstream runtime behavior related to interpreter warning noise and timeout semantics.
